** Ideas:
 - Movement:
   - FPS
   - WASD
   - Jumping
   - Double Jump
   - I want a lot of the games movement to be based around weapons (Like tf2)
** Weapons:
   - Basic:
     - Double Barrel Shotgun
     - Plasma Rifle (Like in DOOM 2016)
     - Rifle
   - More Advanced:
     - Rocket Launcher
     - Zig Zag Rocket Launcher
       - Like the regular rocket launcher, but you have 3 rockets 
       one rocket is to shoot, and the others are to hurt yourself in the
       air to rapidly change direction (Like a cooler beggars bazooka)
     - Land mines
       - Thrown out like a frisbee
       - Takes skill to time it
       - If you land on it, it will immidiately detonate and launch you
     - Adrenaline Rifle
       - You increase in movement speed based on the amount of damage you do
       
       
   
You can only have 3 weapons equipped at once - this is so using weapons doesnt get convaluted or awkward

* Weapons
** Basic
*** Double Barrel Shotgun

- It will contain two shots
- It will be incredibly inaccurate
- The shot will have a large spread
- Has low damage fall off (As you wont be able to hit much from a distance)
- Will have some average

*** Plasma Rifle

- Will have different charge mode:
  - No Charge:
    - Will fire a basic shot that will have small knockback to the player
    - Will have no damage fall off
    - Accurate
    - Contains 5 shots that regenerate with damage done (From any weapon)
    - Uses 1 shot
  - Mininal Charge:
    - Will fire a more powerful shot
    - More knockback
    - Uses 2 shots
  - Full charge:
    - Will fire a really powerful shot
    - Uses 5 shots
    
*** Rifle

- A standard Rifle
- No knockback to the player (Have to have one boring weapon for when knockback is a bad idea)

** Advanced
*** Rocket Launcher
- Shoots a fast moving projectile
- Has a lot of damage fall off
- Provides a lot of knockback
- Has 5 rockets in the magazine (Somehow)

*** Zig Zag Rocket Launcher
- Shoots a regular rocket
- While in the air, you can shoot two more rockets that will hit you and propel you in the opposite direction
- Useful for rapid direction changes
- Creates a large explosion

*** Land mines
- Throwable
- Relatively Large knockback
- When stepping on them, they will immidiately explode
- Can throw multiple while in the air and time it so you surf off of them
- Similar to demomans stickies
*** Adrenaline Rifle
- When you shoot an enemy, you gain +1% speed per damage for 5secs (Max 250%)
- You take no knockback
- For every 100% over the speed limit you go, you will deal 10% more damage and have 10/s more regen

* How will i develop this?
*I will use the Godot Game engine*
** Research
- [ ] I must learn about 3D
- [ ] I must learn about how to manage guns (Because it uses scriptable objects in unity but Godot doesnt have them)
- [ ] I must learn about raycasting in Godot
- [ ] I must learn about 3D modeling (Blender)
